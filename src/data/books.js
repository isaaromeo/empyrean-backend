      "Enter the brutal and elite world of a war college for dragon riders from USA Today bestselling author Rebecca Yarros.",
      "Twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant, living a quiet life among books and history. Now, the commanding general—also known as her tough-as-talons mother—has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre: dragon riders.",
      "But when you’re smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away...because dragons don’t bond to “fragile” humans. They incinerate them.",
      "With fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet to better their own chances of success. The rest would kill her just for being her mother’s daughter—like Xaden Riorson, the most powerful and ruthless wingleader in the Riders Quadrant.",
      "She’ll need every edge her wits can give her just to see the next sunrise.",
      "Yet, with every day that passes, the war outside grows more deadly, the kingdom's protective wards are failing, and the death toll continues to rise. Even worse, Violet begins to suspect leadership is hiding a terrible secret.",
      "Friends, enemies, lovers. Everyone at Basgiath War College has an agenda—because once you enter, there are only two ways out: graduate or die.",

    summary: [
      "In a kingdom torn by war, twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail never imagined herself on a battlefield—let alone flying above one. Frail from birth, and raised among books and scrolls, her path was meant to lead to the Scribe Quadrant: quiet, safe, and far from the bloodshed. But her mother, the unyielding and fearsome General Sorrengail, has other plans. Instead of parchment, Violet is forced into the deadly Rider Quadrant at Basgiath War College, where dragons bond with riders… and kill those they deem unworthy.",
      "From the very first day, survival is not guaranteed. Violet must cross a narrow parapet high above the ground, watched by dragons, enemies, and her own doubts. Many fall. She doesn’t. And that sets the tone for her journey: she is underestimated, always, and always proves them wrong.",
      "At Basgiath, brutality is part of the curriculum. Students train to kill and are encouraged to eliminate their rivals—permanently. Violet’s small size and brittle bones mark her as prey, and some cadets make it clear they plan to see her dead. Yet she endures, leaning on her intelligence, strategy, and a will that refuses to bend.",
      "Among those watching her closely is Xaden Riorson, the intimidating wing leader with a past soaked in blood and rebellion. His father led an uprising against the kingdom, and Violet’s mother ordered his execution. Now, Violet finds herself training beside the orphaned children of that rebellion—people who should want her dead. Strangely, they don’t. Not all of them.",
      "As months pass, Violet survives tests of strength and wit, forging unlikely bonds. She even manages to do the impossible: she forms not one, but two dragon bonds—one with the mighty black dragon Tairn, and another with a golden hatchling named Andarna. The magic they share gives Violet the power of lightning, but it also paints a target on her back. Riders are rare. Dual-bonded riders? Practically myths.",
      "Romance ignites, slowly and tensely, with Xaden. What begins as wary respect deepens into trust—and something more. But as Violet draws closer to him, she begins to uncover a truth that threatens everything she’s been taught. The war isn’t what it seems. The kingdom isn’t what it claims to be. And beyond the protective border of Navarre lie enemies that don’t bleed like men.",
      "In a final test of loyalty and courage, Violet and her squad face off against the terrifying Venin—creatures made of magic and rot—long hidden from the public by a regime that prefers control over truth. The cost is high. Friends are lost. Secrets are unearthed. And in the aftermath, Violet learns her brother—who she believed dead—is alive, and working with the very rebels her mother has sworn to destroy.",
